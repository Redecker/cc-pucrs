Information systems and organizations influence one another. Information systems are built by managers to serve the interests of the business firm. At the same time, the organization must be aware of and open to the influences of information systems to benefit from new technologies. All modern organizations are hierarchical, specialized, and impartial, using explicit routines to maximize efficiency. All organizations have their own cultures and politics arising from differences in interest groups, and they are affected by their surrounding environment. Organizations differ in goals,
groups served, social roles, leadership styles, incentives, types of tasks performed, and type of structure. Information systems and the organizations in which they are used interact with and influence each
other. The introduction of a new information system will affect organizational structure, goals, work
design, values, competition between interest groups, decision making, and day-to-day behavior. At the
same time, information systems must be designed to serve the needs of important organizational groups
and will be shaped by the organization’s structure, business processes, goals, culture, politics, and
management. Information technology can reduce costs, and such changes have been accentuated in organizations using the Internet. 
A way that organizations can differ is by the tasks they perform and the technology they use. Some organizations perform primarily routine tasks that can be reduced to formal rules that require little judgment, whereas others work primarily with nonroutine tasks.
