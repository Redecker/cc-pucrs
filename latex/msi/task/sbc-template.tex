\section{One consulting firm has predicted that video and
Web conferencing will make business travel
extinct. Do you agree? Why or why not?}
No, There are still plenty of task when face-to-face interactions are required. In some occasions, a meet in person can transmit more security to the customer and also can show more confidence. Other thing that a business travel can do is networking with others potential clients.   

\section{What is the distinction between videoconferencing
and telepresence?}

Videoconferencing allows individuals at two or more locations to communicate simultaneously by the internet. Telepresence, for the other hand, strives to make the communication as real as possible, making the users feel as they are actually present in a location different from their own. Telepresence can be considered the state-of-art of videoconferencing.

\section{What are the ways in which videoconferencing
provides value to a business? Would you consider
it smart management? Explain your answer.}
With videoconferencing the business can reduce costs and give quickly answer for a customer or for a other sector of the company. With videoconferencing the business can spend less time and money in travels, and with this time the executives can do productive things instead of be in a car or in a plane. 

\section{If you were in charge of a small business, would
you choose to implement videoconferencing?
What factors would you consider in your
decision?}
It is important for a company realize if this kind of technology is really needed and if it will give profit for the company in some way. But if the company has contacts with other companies or customers outside of your location, it is a good alternative of communication to avoid the travels.
